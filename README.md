## 1. 3  [Wireframes ](/wireframes/MS4.png)
[See Wireframes ](/wireframes/MS4.png)
<span id="Wireframes"></span>

These wireframes where designed  with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/4KmzBdwzyrvZAVXoKUaZVM/MS4?node-id=0%3A1)
which is a very instuitive prototyping tool that focuses in the user interface and user experience design.

## 1.4 Design
<span id="Design"></span>
This website was designed using [ecommerce](https://startbootstrap.com/templates/ecommerce)
A basic Bootstrap ecommerce page template from [startboostrap](https://startbootstrap.com/).
This template was chosen thinking on a minimalist 
concept which transmits serenity and tranquillity. Therefore, all pages are diaphanous but functional, avoiding the overuse of colors which could be stressful  and overwhelming for the users.
Hence, black and  white are the predominant colors. There are also some other colors such as yellow, green, red and blue in puntual elements as bottoms, icons and links.

**Colors**
- Black #000000: used for the font, icons, and some alerts.
- White #ffffff: used for the body  
- Gray ##636262: used when hover in the links 
- Green #26a69a: edit buttons in profile page
- Red #e15562: user for the delete button in the admin's edit form and in the revome link from the shopping bag. 
- Yellow #ffc107: user for the alert in the shopping bag when the shipping price has not been reached.

**Font**

The Fonts used in this site are Lato and Monserrat which were taken from google.fonts. The Monserrat is used in the landing page for the visual impact it has on the visitors due to its width. On the other hand, Lato is the predominant font found since its thickness offers the space between each letter making it easier for the user to read. In general terms these fonts fit perfectly with the eastethics of the site and offer a perfect contrast which helps the user to distinguis between title, notification and general information.

The defensive design on this site relays on the Djiango built-in models which makes the site secure and straightforward when setting parameters as placeholder, input length or compulsory requirements.

2. Features

2.1. Existing features

This feature is the main page of the site. Here users will come across with all the recipes sorted out by the different types of alcohol each cocktail uses. Besides user can find in the navigation-bar the option to register and login in order to have access to more features. Moreover, Users can also use the search-bar to speed up the search of a recipe.

2.1.2 Navigation bar:
This website has a navigation bar that displays different features depending on the actions te user takes. If a user registers and logs in, then the features from the navigation bar will be different from those who do not do it. A first time visitor will only find in the Nabvar the chance to register and login. And if they create an account the Navbar will display also the options to add a recipe, log out or user profile.
